# devstep-cli

Work in progress rewrite of the [devstep](http://fgrehm.viewdocs.io/devstep) CLI code.

## TODO

* [x] `devstep hack`
* [ ] `devstep build`
* [ ] `devstep hack` on top of a previously built image
* [ ] `devstep bootstrap`
* [ ] Custom `docker run` options for `devstep hack`
* [ ] User and project specific configs for the `devstep` commands (current `.devsteprc`)
* [ ] `devstep clean`
* [ ] Figure out why we need to hit enter after exiting a docker attach
